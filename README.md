# Handwriting Classification Project

This project classifies handwriting images into two categories: **Good Handwriting** and **Bad Handwriting**. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model evaluates and predicts the quality of handwriting. This project includes three main components:
1. **Image Data Augmentation**: Expands the dataset through transformations.
2. **Model Training**: Trains a CNN model to classify handwriting images.
3. **Prediction Interface**: Provides a function to evaluate new handwriting images.
